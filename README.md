# Bank Customer Complaint Analysis

## **Introduction**
In this project, I developed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model for bank customer complaint 
analysis using historical data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) website. The primary
goal of the model is to automatically classify and route complaints to the appropriate teams based on the 
content and associated financial products, thereby improving the efficiency and accuracy of complaint handling. 
After training and testing the model, it achieved an accuracy of 88%, demonstrating its strong potential in accurately
classifying and analyzing customer complaints, which can help financial institutions resolve consumer issues more effectively.

## **Background**
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) acts as a mediator between financial institutions and
consumers, facilitating dispute resolution when complaints arise. To improve efficiency and accuracy in
handling customer complaints, there is a need for natural language processing (NLP) models to
automatically classify and route complaints to the appropriate teams based on their content and
associated financial products. This project aims to develop an NLP model for bank customer complaint
analysis, leveraging historical data from the CFPB website.
